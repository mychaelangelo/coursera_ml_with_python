# Machine Learning with Python Lab Work

This repo contains my lab work for the "Machine Learning with Python" course offered by Coursera in collaboration with IBM. It's part of a personal learning challenge called **100 Days of AI**. This involves learning about AI every day for 100 days. 

## Disclaimer

All the work included here is rough and high level. The models and implementations provided should not be relied upon. They are solely for educational and learning purposes.

## Course Overview

In this course, I've explore various machine learning algorithms, techniques, and tools using Python. The course covers:

- Data pre-processing and cleaning
- Regression analysis
- Classification algorithms
- Clustering techniques
- Model evaluation and validation
- Feature selection and engineering

## Repository Structure

- Each lab exercise is organized into separate folders.
- Inside each folder, you'll find a variety of python files and datasets.

## How to Use

Feel free to dive into the code and experiment with different approaches. However, remember that the models provided here are basic implementations for educational purposes.
